in a terminal session:

cd <path to local repository>
git pull (to get any updates from remote)
make edits to whatever files you want
git add <edited filename>
git commit -m "description of update"
git push



git status (use at any point to see status of local vs remote)
git diff (to show differences of any changed files vs remote)
